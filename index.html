    <!--overview-->
    <h2 style="color: rgb(242, 255, 0);">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I do have some other ideas, but this is what I am leaning towards right now.
        This web game will use an api to obtain words and hints. Currently I am thinking
        about making a hangman game. The user can roll dice to choose how many letters the given 
        word will be. Then when a word is chosen, a category or hint of some kind will show up on 
        screen. The api can provide words, hints, definitions, and examples. Guess the wrong letter
        or make an incorrect guess too many times and you loose. There is also a scoring and 
        leaderboard system.
    </p>

    <p>
        This application would use the Merriam Webster api to obtain words hints and definitions.
        It will be written in html, javascript, json, as well as css, and hosted on Azure.
        There will also be a database used to set and display scores.

    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>a timer, where you either need to get the word in x amount of time,

    <!--basic technical features list-->
    <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 13);">Technical Features</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>obtaining information from an api</li>
        <li>retrieving data from a database</li>
        <li>writing to a database</li>
    </ul>
    <!--advanced technical features list-->
    <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 255, 0);">Advanced Technical Features</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Asynchronous Loading of High Scores</li>
        <li>Asynchronous Loading of an amount of words equal to the number rolled on the dice
            (so if a game goes to 10, I need to load in 10 words, and then I can store them
            in a list, and once one of the word is guessed, I can move on to the next one)
        </li>
    </ul>
