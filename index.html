    <!--overview-->
    <h2 style="color: rgb(242, 255, 0);">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I do have some other ideas, but this is what I am leaning towards right now.
        This web game will use an api to obtain words and hints. Currently I am thinking
        about making a hangman game. The user can roll dice to choose how many letters the given 
        word will be. Then when a word is chosen, a category or hint of some kind will show up on 
        screen. The api can provide words, hints, definitions, and examples. Guess the wrong letter
        or make an incorrect guess too many times and you loose. There is also a scoring and 
        leaderboard system.
    </p>

    <p>
        This application would use the Merriam Webster api to obtain words hints and definitions.
        It will be written in html, javascript, json, as well as css, and hosted on Azure.
        There will also be a database used to set and display scores.
